Gomobile uses API key authentication. Every API request requires a valid API key in the request header.

## Getting your API key

API keys are provisioned by the Gomobile team.

<Info>
**Need API access?** [Request your API key](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F6_7OIDNq8_lWgKPyP-DudF3dvBTl31X4dqVf5St2zE) and our team will set you up within 24 hours.
</Info>

Once you receive your API key, store it securely and use it for all API requests.

## How to authenticate

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header of every request:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
**Important:** Use `x-api-key` header, not `Authorization: Bearer`. Using Bearer token format will result in a `401 Unauthorized` error.
</Warning>

## Making authenticated requests

Here's an example of an authenticated request to verify your API key:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/users/me \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "user-uuid",
  "email": "you@yourcompany.com",
  "firstName": "Your",
  "lastName": "Name",
  "organization": {
    "id": "org-uuid",
    "name": "Your Company",
    "slug": "your-company"
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

Store your API key as an environment variable to keep it secure:

```bash
# Store your key as an environment variable
export GOMOBILE_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Use it in requests
curl -X GET https://api.gomobile.ma/api/users/me \
  -H "x-api-key: $GOMOBILE_API_KEY"
```

## Security best practices

- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- **Use environment variables** or a secrets manager
- **Keep your API key private** — don't share it in public forums, emails, or chat
- **Contact support** immediately if your key is compromised

## Common authentication errors

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid, missing, or wrong header format | Verify your API key and ensure you're ung `x-api-key` header (not `Authorization: Bearer`) |
| `403 Forbidden` | Valid token but insufficient permissions | Contact support to check your account permissions |
